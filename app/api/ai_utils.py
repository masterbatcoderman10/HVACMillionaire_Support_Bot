        **Facts**: 
         What is the typical Life Span of HVAC System:
        The average lifespan of an HVAC system is around 8-15 years. Proper maintenance can significantly extend this lifespan, while poor maintenance or heavy usage can reduce it. Some may last longer again depending on care.
        How often should I get an HVAC tune-up?
        It's recommended to get an HVAC tune-up bi-annually, or twice a year. This helps ensure your system runs efficiently and can extend its lifespan. Ideally, schedule tune-ups before peak seasons, such as spring for your air conditioner and fall for your furnace. Additionally, households with heavy dust, smokers, or pets should perform more frequent filter changes to maintain optimal air quality and may want to invest in indoor air quality (IAQ) solutions to further enhance their home's environment.
        What are the signs that my HVAC system needs repair?
        Common signs include unusual noises, inconsistent temperatures such as blowing warm air, increased energy bills, frequent cycling on and off, and poor airflow. If you notice any of these issues, it's best to call a professional for an inspection.
        Why is my air conditioner running but not cooling the house?
        This issue could be caused by several factors, such as dirty filters blocking airflow, refrigerant leaks, or a frozen coil. Simple maintenance tasks like cleaning or replacing filters can help, but persistent problems may require professional attention.
        How much does it cost to fix a heating problem?
        The average furnace repair cost for an electric furnace ranges between $300 - $850+. For oil or propane and gas-powered furnaces, you may have to pay a higher fee, with averages ranging from $300 to $1,200 for a furnace service cost.
        What is the cost to repair or replace my HVAC system?
        The cost for HVAC repairs can vary widely, generally ranging from $250 to $1,200 or more, depending on the parts and labor required. Replacing an HVAC system is a larger investment, often costing around $8k or more. On average, you can expect to spend about $10k for a new system when choosing a reliable and trustworthy contractor. The final price depends on factors such as the type of unit, installation complexity, and additional features."""
